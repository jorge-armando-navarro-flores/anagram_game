## The mechanics of the game are as follows:

The game provides the user with a word from the dictionary. <br>
The user tries to create as many words as possible that contain all the letters of the given word plus one additional letter. <br>
Note that adding the extra letter at the beginning or the end without reordering the other letters is not valid. <br>
For example, if the game picks the word 'ore' as a starter, the user might guess 'rose' or 'zero' but not 'sore'.<br>
The user can give up and see the words that they did not guess.
